# carFinder
The **carFinder** app is an app that allows the user to search for used vehicles for sale at
dealerships near their phones GPS location. The app will return the 10 physically closest matches 
to the car or truck you are looking for.

# Motivation
I built this app for an Android app development course that I took. The goal was to learn about developing for the Android
platform while utilizing a special feature of the platform and a third party API  [Marketcheck.com](https://www.marketcheck.com)
